# Options Market Making Trading Bot

## Description

This project involves the development of a market making bot designed to delve into the intricacies of options pricing theory and arbitrage trading strategies. The goal is to apply these concepts in a practical, real-world setting. The bot operates by leveraging simulated Level 2 market data and employs the Black-Scholes pricing model to inform its trading decisions, aiming to minimize holding risk associated with European options through a delta neutral trading approach.

## Features

- **Simulation of Level 2 Market Data**: Utilizes a simulated trading environment to test trading strategies without financial risk.
- **Black-Scholes Pricing**: Implements the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of options.
- **Delta Neutral Strategy**: Aims to hedge options positions to be price movement neutral, reducing the risk of adverse price movements in the underlying assets.
- **Continuous Integration**: Regular updates and improvements pushed to the GitHub repository, with a clear versioning system.
